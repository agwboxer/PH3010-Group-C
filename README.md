# PH3010 Group project

Group C have decided to do the 'Investigating Orbital Dynamics' project. Our primary goal is to use different numerical methods to simulate the orbit of Mercury around the Sun. Through this we are able to determine the validity of such numerical methods, comapring them to other methods and obervational data.
